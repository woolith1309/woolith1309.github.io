          <p>KOL, better known as Key Opinion Leaders, are what consumers are gravitating towards in hopes to filter the
            clutter that digital advertising has created.</p>
          <p>Key Opinion Leaders allow brands to effectively allocate their marketing budget because of the targeted,
            niche audience
            the influencer has access to.</p>
          <p>According to a study by McKinsey, KOLs, which is trusted and sought after by
            consumers, has twice the communication and word-of-mouth benefits as paid
            advertising, and its retention rate is 37% higher than other ways. </p>

                  <p>On February 20th 2018, CBNData and Alibaba have jointly released the “ 2017 iFashion consumption
                    trend” based on the Big Data collected by Alibaba. They found that young consumers prefer to follow
                    influencers.Pure product presentation no longer provides a compelling stimulus for consumers to buy.
                    Meanwhile, popular celebrities, KOLs, UGC from peers and PGC from designers has become a strong
                    driver for consumers to purchase. Consumers tend to trust their identity presentation and sense of
                    taste. They tend to imitate them and buy similar products.</p>

                  <p>Apart from celebrities, more and more KOLs (Key Opinion Leaders) are influencing the fashion
                    industry. According to CBNData’s report, KOLs can convert lower budgets into higher traffic
                    generation with a strong fan effect, increasing their sales conversion rate. Moreover, vertical
                    industry KOLs are increasing. Consumers tend to favour KOLs with a specialisation. For example,
                    wild-eyed Loli has established her sporty KOL image on Weibo, which help her increase her revenue on
                    Taobao over 90% for sportswear.

                  <p>Greater collaboration between streaming and KOLs hit the fashion industry in recent years. Compared
                    with traditionally displaying the product picture on the website, in this model, more content can be
                    expected. KOLs normally fully introduce the products with script offered by the brand officials and
                    some of their own experiences after using. According to CBNData,
                    High interactivity is an outstanding feature of live broadcasting, with the interaction rate often
                    reaching 20%-30%. At the present stage, this interactive selling mode with strong publicity and
                    favourable prices gives consumers huge attraction.

                    <p>&ldquo;As for the individual buying behavior influenced by KOL, Leo LI, a male year 4 student
                      from Hong Kong Baptist University answered this question.

                      Mr. LI tends to focus on alcoholic drink bloggers and photography bloggers. Compared to listening
                      to shopping assistant in the shopping mall, he prefers the recommendations from the KOl’s videos.

                      He also mentioned that he could realize KOL’s promotion on products, but he would not feel bored
                      or abhorrent facing their promotion video. He would purchase the product only when he actually had
                      a need to satisfy and he thought himself as a rational consumer.

                      “I think what I have bought before from KOL’s recommendation such as camera roll and fruit beer
                      fit my imagination. This may due to my personal affection for wine and photography, and also my
                      careful study and observation towards KOL’s evaluation,” Leo said.

                      However, Mr.LI also had experience of impulse buying. Once he watched a KOL’s video on promoting a
                      special clothing deodorant, he felt novel and after he found the price is low enough, he decided
                      to buy one immediately.

                      “Although I bought it without consideration, it is as useful as what the KOl said in the video. I
                      am satisfied,” he said.
                      &rdquo;</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;While for such ridiculous mainland market phenomenon, Dr Melannie Zhang, from Hong Kong
                      Baptist University, pointed out that it is resulted from the shift in male aesthetics.

                      “We can see there are many popular male stars famous for their delicate faces from 2016 to 2019.
                      They are called as ‘fresh meat’,” she said.

                      Ms. Zhang thought that the popularity of exquisite male stars in entertainment industry has
                      released signal that boys can also pay attention to make-up and skin care as girls, “‘Delicacy’
                      has become synonymous with boys, which is new requirement put on boys by the market.”

                      Apart from the change of aesthetics of Chinese men, she said that the way to get shopping skills
                      by watching Kol videos is in line with the consumption psychology of male consumers.

                      “Male consumers may be embarrassed when shopping mall assistants gave suggestions or
                      recommendations for them. Compared to listening suggestions in the shopping mall, watching Kol’s
                      video at home makes them relaxed,” she said.

                special clothing deodorant, he felt novel and after he found the price is low enough, he decided to buy
                one immediately.</p>

              <p> “Although I bought it without consideration, it is as useful as what the KOl said in the video. I am
                satisfied,” he said.</p>

              <p>While for such ridiculous mainland market phenomenon, Dr Melannie Zhang, from Hong Kong Baptist
                University, pointed out that it is resulted from the shift in male aesthetics.</p>

              <p> “We can see there are many popular male stars famous for their delicate faces from 2016 to 2019. They
                are called as ‘fresh meat’,” she said.</p>

              <p>Ms. Zhang thought that the popularity of exquisite male stars in entertainment industry has released
                signal that boys can also pay attention to make-up and skin care as girls, “‘Delicacy’ has become
                synonymous with boys, which is new requirement put on boys by the market.”</p>

              <p>Apart from the change of aesthetics of Chinese men, she said that the way to get shopping skills by
                watching Kol videos is in line with the consumption psychology of male consumers.</p>

              <p>“Male consumers may be embarrassed when shopping mall assistants gave suggestions or recommendations
                for
                them. Compared to listening suggestions in the shopping mall, watching Kol’s video at home makes them
                relaxed,” she said.</p>

              <p> In the last three years, the number of google searches for ‘influencer marketing’ has grown 1500%. In
                accordance with Influencer Marketing Hub, the KOL marketing industry is estimated to reach 10 billion by
                2020. KOL economy was booming for these few years and there was still a large room for it to further
                develop as the demands and importance of it becomes larger. It is a new marketing approach not just in
                China, but on a global scale. The overall CTR in China for display advertisements is
                only 0.12% and the average CTR for Google Advertisement on the display network across all industries is
                only 0.46%. To deal with the low CTR numbers, many businesses change their tactics by using KOL
                marketing.</p>
              <img src="assets/images/future.png" height=200px>
              <p>Talking about the future KOL trend, Zhou mentioned KOL 1.0 version is the grassroot celebrity, 2.0
                version is active in Weibo, 3.0 is now active in all social and live streaming platforms. In the future,
                KOLs in vertical field will rise rapidly and have larger space to grow. Meanwhile, KOL agencies will
                search widely for top KOLs, and there will be a team analyzing KOL positioning and engaging with brands
                to amplify the KOL effects. A more powerful KOL is not a real person but a virtual IP.</p>

              products</a>
            <div id="exampleAccordion2" class="collapse" role="tabpanel">
              <p>KOLs have established trust with their audience, they can be more convincing than traditional
                advertisements or branded content. A Mediakix survey conducted at the end of 2018 found that 49% of
                consumers depend on KOLs’ recommendations for their purchase decisions. The numbers are even higheFr for
                Millennials and those in Gen-Z!</p>
              <p> According to the survey done by Hong Kong Baptist University, around 70% of teenage respondents said
                that they did purchase any KOL promotion products, however, they discovered that the quality of these
                goods were not as good as what the KOL stated, especially for the food. Over 30% of respondents agreed
                with the main job for KOL is selling the goods within their blog, videos or posts, therefore they may
                not only sell the products in a good quality, but they hope that the KOL could declare the advertisement
                parts in their social network. Some experts described this situation is related to the relationship
                between KOL and supporters and it would directly affect the income from advertisement, maybe it is
                because the feelings that everyone has towards the products or services are varied. They suggested that
                customers should consider more information and opinions before buying anything.</p>

              <p>Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life
                One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World
                of Grammar.Although KOL leads to lots of benefits and profits for the business, the coin has two sides,
                there must be some problems exist in KOL economics. First, there isn’t any standardized pricing for each
                KOL for promoting goods, even the KOL are in the same grade. For the business side, they need to look
                for the KOLs one by one randomly on Instagram, Facebook , YouTube or other social networking sites,
                which is too time consuming. After they shortlisted the KOL out, they still need to verify them if they
                are real or not. In conclusion, the engagement rate of influencers is really dramatically increasing or
                decreasing. </p>


              <p>
                Second, it caused negative effects to traditional advertising. The traditional advertising is difficulty
                getting in touch with the customers by magazines, newspaper or TV since lots of people are using the
                internet instead of watching TV and their consumption behavior would be affected by the KOL more than
                the original advertisement.

              <p>
                Thirdly, the fake data problem happens in China’s KOL advertising. One of China's leading muti-channel
                network (MCN) companies was intended to generate 1m impressions for the company’s new product to promote
                blood circulation and they were working with fashion vlogger YuHan (Weibo: @张雨晗YuHan) who had 3.8
                million Weibo followers.
